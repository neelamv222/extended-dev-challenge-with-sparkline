                <h2>Understanding and Assumptions:</h2>
                <h3>Assignments consist of two parts:</h3>
                <div>Part 1: <b> A Sorted table:</b>
					<p> According to my understanding in Part 1 which is "Sorted Table" we have to show currency pairs in a table with a single row for each unique currency pair and include columns for the following</p>
                    <ol>
						<li> Name</li>
						<li> the current best bid price</li>
						<li> current best ask price</li>
						<li> the amount that the best bid last changed</li>
						<li> the amount the best price last changed</li>
					<ol>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>So I did the following in <b>part 1</b>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Firstly, remove the duplicate currency pair and show only the one with highest "best bid last changed" value.</li>
                        <li>After this, sort above result set again based on the "best bid last changed" in descending order </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>Part 2: <b>Sparkline:</b>
                   <p> In the second part, we have to draw a graph (sparkline) in the last column for each row.
                    So, <b> my graph (sparkline) will get display on the screen after 30 secs. And thereafter, the graph will keep on updating over the most recent data that comes from the server.</b>
                    The sparkline is calculated as the midprice over the 30 seconds. 
                    The midprice is calculated by adding the bestBid and bestAsk fields together and dividing by 2 as mentioned in the assignment.</p>
